# Drano â€“ Cleaning up your pipes #

Drano is a small javascript library for managing and working with WebSockets, it handles the reconnecting of them if they get disconnected and also the sending of data. Hopefully it's actually useful to someone.

## Usage ##

For now, it's best just to read the source code, it's not too complicated. I'll be adding documentation later.

## Contributing ##
